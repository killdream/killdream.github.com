*Sometimes I look like this.*
{: .pull-right}

I'm a programmer, artist, writer, and programming language designer from Brazil. I've been working on software professionally for about 8 years now. During that time I've helped build (and led the development of) [user interfaces](TODO), [web applications](TODO), [programming languages](TODO), and [developer tooling](TODO).

Outside of my daily job I've also worked on [computer games](TODO) and [open-source software](https://github.com/robotlolita) for things that mattered to me. The experiences of working with so many different people, all across the world, were really valuable to me.

*People* are still my biggest motivation. I want to work on more projects that will have a positive impact on their lives. I want to help build technology that will let people achieve their goals more efficiently. I even made my short bio “working to make computing more human-centric!”
